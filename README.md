# minimal_launcher

A minimal launcher app built using Flutter.

Note! : This app will work only in Android, cause duh it's obvious :D 

## V 1.0

The app features a minimalistic black and white design with a time widget and allows the user to reorder (quite buggy as its the first build) his favourite apps and bring them up the list.

The apk is large in size as it's a fat APK. (A fat APK is a single APK that contains the binaries for multiple ABIs (Application Binary Interface) embedded within it).

There are some rendering issues but that are fixable (hopefuly) in the future.
The code is messy and there's a lot of boilerplate code. Also I've put a random 'M' on the launch screen :p.
I was curious to see if a Flutter app was good enough to replace a native android launcher app, I'm not quite satisfied with the result but it can be improved with more optimizations in the future!
